If you have more than 10 effective commits (abbreviated to EC) merged into the [Go Repos](https://github.com/orgs/golang/repositories), feel free to [send an email to apply for membership.](mailto:join@golangcn.org) You will also get an email account with the suffix `@golangcn.org` permanently, for email activation [see doc](../email-settings).

Please note that the aforementioned "effective commits" implies source code changes such as bug fixes, global/local optimizations, functionality refactorings and new features, etc.

NFC (non functional commits) such as typo fixes, test case supplementations and code cleanup work are not considered as EC. Since we pursue not only the title of `golang contributor`, but also deep understanding the Go internals and improving our coding skills.

Being a member of the Club, you can enjoy a wide range of exclusive benefits and unparalleled job opportunities.
