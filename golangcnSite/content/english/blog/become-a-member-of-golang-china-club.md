If you have more than 10 effective commits (abbreviated to __EC__) merged into the [Go Repos](https://github.com/orgs/golang/repositories), feel free to [send an email to apply for membership.](mailto:join@golangcn.org) You will also get an email account with the suffix `@golangcn.org` permanently, for email activation [see doc](../email-settings).

Please note that the aforementioned term "effective commits" implies source code changes such as bug fixes, global/local optimizations, functionality refactoring works, new features, and stability improvements, etc.

Non functional commits (__NFC__ for short) including but not limit to typo fixes, documentation additions, test case additions, code cleanups, and other minor changes (with little impact on functionality/performance/stability) will not be considered as __EC__.

Of course, ultimately whether your CLs are classified as EC or NFC is a matter for the club members to decide together based on the actual situation.

Being a member of the Club, you can enjoy a wide range of exclusive benefits and unparalleled job opportunities.

* Get a permanent email account with the suffix `@golangcn.org`
* Join in our [Github group](https://github.com/golangclub)
* Get invited to our annual 'China Golang Contributor Summit'

Some more clarification,

* We are not a profitable club, and all cost is shared by the members.
* We are a private club with no commercial involvement to Golang's official community.
* We encourage EC than NFC, since we pursue not only the title of 'golang contributor', but also deep understanding of the Go internals.
